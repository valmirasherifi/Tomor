/*this is a comment
Data types in variables
undefined hasnt been defined
null means nothing
boolean meeans true or fals talks abut strings
symbol
number
object can store a lot of pairs
Variable allows to stroe data, shes as a box. var myName = "Youssef"
myName = 8
let ourName = "freeCodeCamp"
const pi = 3.14 (you can never changed)
